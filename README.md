When learning to use an unfamiliar language, I typically like to translate a previous project I've created and add a new wrinkle to it. I will be using a .csv file containing ZIP code information in the United States. Some basic functionality I would like the first iteration to display is the ability to accept user input to look for a corresponding row (Ex: input = "27514", output = "Chapel Hill").
